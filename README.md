**Overview**
This project consists of an analysis and coding exercise related to puffins and substring operations. The project includes a Jupyter notebook for data exploration or modeling, along with a Python script and a corresponding test suite for an algorithmic task.

**Project Structure**

puffins.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook containing analysis or visualizations of puffin-related data, potentially including data loading, cleaning, processing, and plotting. It provides insights or solutions related to puffin studies.

longest_sub.py: This script defines a function to find the longest substring that meets certain conditions. The function is optimized for performance and reliability.

test_longest_sub.py: This script includes unit tests for the longest_sub.py module, ensuring the correctness and reliability of the longest substring function.

puffins.csv: A CSV file containing puffin-related data, used in the puffins.ipynb notebook. This dataset may include variables related to puffin species, habitat, behavior, or other relevant characteristics.
